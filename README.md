# professional-portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project was to learn how to build a professional portfolio structure with only HTML and CSS. I created this project because I wanted to experience and know-how tedious building a website from scratch truly is. The problem this website solves is that it allows potential employers to learn about me and my skills. In addition, I realized that there are many ways to display what you want.

## Usage
This website can be navigated using the navbar in the upper right corner. Pressing the home button (or scrolling downwards) will take you to the site's intro, which introduces you to a photo and a brief statement about who I am. If you press the contact button, you will be taken to the contact section where you can send me a message (however, it doesn't work right now because I didn't use Javascript). You will also notice that the site's banner will follow you as you scroll. If you click on the projects tab, you will see all of my deployable applications.
